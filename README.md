## Security Practices

### JWT Authentication

Ensures that users are authenticated before accessing protected routes. Each request must include a valid token.

### Role-based Authorization

Different roles such as `admin` and `user` have varying levels of access. Middleware checks ensure users have the necessary permissions.

### Input Validation

Middleware functions like `date_validation_middleware.js` validate user inputs to prevent invalid data from being processed.

### Data Sanitization

Libraries such as `xss-clean` and `express-mongo-sanitize` are used to sanitize user inputs and prevent XSS and NoSQL injection attacks.

### HTTP Headers

`helmet` is used to set secure HTTP headers, protecting the app from common vulnerabilities.

### Error Handling

Custom error classes standardize error responses, improving the clarity and consistency of error handling.

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_name>
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**:
   Create a `.env` file and add the necessary environment variables.

4. **Run the server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Conclusion

This backend structure is designed to be scalable, maintainable, and secure, making it an excellent foundation for any hotel booking system. Enjoy building and enhancing your application!
